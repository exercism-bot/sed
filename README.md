# Exercism sed track

Sed (**S**tream **ED**itor) is a very practical and fun Turing-Complete esoteric language mostly used for text manipulations.

## Language variant

We'll use [GNU Sed][sed-home] with all GNU extensions (except `e` command) and [*ERE* (Extended Regular Expression)](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/html_node/ERE-syntax.html#ERE-syntax) in this track.

## Testing framework

Testing will be done with [`bats-core`][bats] from the **Bash Track**.

## Main Resources
